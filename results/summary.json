Even though the implications are similar to the minimal supersymmetric standard model, BLSSM can predict another Higgs boson lighter than 150 GeV. We find that the second Higgs boson can be degenerate with the lightest charge parity (CP)-even Higgs boson of mass about 125 GeV and contribute to the Higgs decay into two photons. In addition, it can provide an explanation for the excess in h\\u21924l at the mass scale \\u223c145\\u2009\\u2009GeV.", "url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.93.055024"}, {"name": "Cross-fertilising extra gauge boson searches at the LHC", "publisher": "J.
